Run Steps:
1. git clone https://github.com/McLarenAppliedTechnologies/MAT-Coding-Challenge.git
2. cd MAT-Coding-Challenge; docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d; cd -
3. docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
4. go to http://localhost:8084/dashboard

(step 3 above requires default external network mat-coding-challenge_default)

main.py Notes:
Requirements:-
- paho-mqtt
- influxdb
- haversine

Improvements to consider:
1. Write pytest assertions
2. Include app logging


Cloud Deployment:
1. locate close to mqtt broker for fast communication (same region, availability domain)
2. capacity planning required to understand hardware and performance requirements (test response time, throughput, cpu, mem, network, I/O utilization)
3. monitoring service such as prometheus/alertmanager to scrape desired metrics and publish to dahsboard such as grafana 
4. influxdb-relay for replication and HA.
5. kubernetes cluster with two nodes, deployment/pod/replicaSet for each app/influxdb layer.
6. Ideally Each node within a separate availability domain or datacenter.
7. Use tool for provisioning cloud infrastructure such as terraform.
